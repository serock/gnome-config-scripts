# GNOME Config Scripts

The scripts in this repository are for customizing [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) settings.
They are not intended to be used *as is* by anyone except myself.
This is because some settings, like those for the weather location, background picture, or favorite apps, are probably not what most people would want.
Consider the scripts to be example code.

There are different branches corresponding to different releases of GNOME.
If I'm using GNOME 45, then I use the scripts on the `gnome-45` branch.

I typically run the scripts once only after performing a clean installation of a Linux distribution.
